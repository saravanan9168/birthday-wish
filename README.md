# Birthday Wishes (React + Vite)

A small React app to display birthday wishes and an Admin page to add/remove them. Data is stored in localStorage so you can try it instantly without a backend.

## Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Features
- Public home page shows wishes in an attractive card layout
- Admin page (`/admin`) to add, edit and delete wishes (stored in localStorage)
- Simple responsive layout and CSS styles with Google Fonts

## Notes & next steps
- If you want a persistent backend, I can add a small Express/Next.js backend or Firebase integration.
- We can add image upload, user authentication for admin, and export/import of wishes.
